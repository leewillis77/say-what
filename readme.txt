* **Improved performance** using text-domain-specific filters

* **Multi-lingual support** - set different replacements for different languages on multi-lingual sites
* **Import/export features** - Easy import/export of replacements through the user interface

You're free to use this plugin free of charge, but if you do, please consider [buying the world some trees](https://ecologi.com/ademtisoftware?gift-trees&r=ademtisoftware) in return.

== Installation ==

* Install it as you would any other plugin
* Activate it
* Head over to Tools &raquo; Text changes and configure some string replacements

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use it to change any string? =
You can only use the plugin to translate strings which are marked for translation.

= How do I find the string to translate? =
You can either have a guess, or checkout the plugin in question's source code, translatable strings are generally wrapped in __(), _e(), _n(), or _x(), for example:

`$foo = __('This is a translatable string', 'plugin-domain');`

The article [here](https://plugins.leewillis.co.uk/doc_post/replacing-wordpress-strings-context/) shows some examples of what you're looking for. Alternatively, the [Pro version of the plugin](https://plugins.leewillis.co.uk/downloads/say-what-pro/) provides a String Discovery mode which means you can search for strings on your site via autocomplete suggestions.

= Is there any support for importing replacements? =
"Say What?" has preliminary support for exporting, and importing replacements via [http://wp-cli.org/](WP-CLI). The following commands are currently
supported:

* export - Export all current string replacements.
* import - Import string replacements from a CSV file.
* list - Export all current string replacements. Synonym for 'export'.
* update - update string replacements from a CSV file.

See the [GitHub homepage](https://github.com/leewillis77/say-what) for examples.

= Can I set different replacements for different languages? =
Not in the free plugin, however this is available in the [Pro version of the plugin](https://plugins.leewillis.co.uk/downloads/say-what-pro/)
